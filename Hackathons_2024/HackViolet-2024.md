## Impact of GitHub Grant
The GitHub Education Grant helped us create a welcoming and inclusive environment by addressing essential needs during the event. We used the funds to help provide brunch, dinner, and snacks throughout the weekend, ensuring participants stayed energized and focused. Additionally, a portion of the grant was used to purchase merchandise, like tee's, stickers, and totes, creating a sense of community and leaving attendees with keepsakes.
